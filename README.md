# xkcd Scraper

A scraper which will download all of the XKCD comics.

To install all dependencys for this project use "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Using the program

All downloaded comics will go inside the ImageDownloads file and you can specify how much should be downloaded by increasing the counter on the download_img for loop

There is an option using the "Context_write" bool at the top of scraper.py that dictates if you want the text that is shown when you hover over the image on the offical website to be written onto the image

setting "Context_write" to false will just download the images
